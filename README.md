Requirements
------------

- Debian 9 Stretch or Debian 10 Buster
- or [RancherOS](https://rancher.com/rancher-os/) with Alpine console
- 1.5 to 2 GB RAM

#### Info

- mailcow: dockerized requires some ports to be open for incoming connections, so make sure that your firewall is not blocking these.
- Make sure that no other application is interferring with mailcow's configuration, such as another mail service
- A correct DNS setup is crucial to every good mailserver setup, so please make sure you got at least the basics covered before you begin!
- Make sure that your system has a correct date and time setup. This is crucial for stuff like two factor TOTP authentication.
